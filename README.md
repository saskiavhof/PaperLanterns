What is new media? This website is an experimental response to this question. 

Looking at the new media installations at TeamLab Borderless in Tokyo as an example, new media can be an art form. The installations' use of "paper lanters" takes one of the onldest forms of traditional media, paper, and reinvents the art form to create something new, digital, and exciting.

This website was my first time experimenting with the ability to animate using JavaScript.
