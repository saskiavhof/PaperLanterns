# Paper Lanterns: How TeamLab Borderless Displays Paper as New Media

This New Media Webtext Experiment is a reflection on how the most traditional form of media--paper--has been completely reimagined by various forms of New Media. By branching from ideas in the essay “Defining New Media Art” by Mark Tribe and Reena Jana, I “hacked” the website template to create a moving art piece about paper lanterns. Specifically, I wanted to use this piece to talk about my first hand experience with an exhibit at TeamLab Borderless in Tokyo where digital paper lanterns created a new media art piece. Along with images and text, users of this website will see animations of Paper Lanterns floating up into the air.

This website was my first time experimenting with the ability to animate only using CSS.
